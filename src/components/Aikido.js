        Aikido is a Japanese martial art founded in the early 20th century by Morihei Ueshiba (1883-1969), also known as O-Sensei (Great Teacher). O-Sensei was a master of several Samurai arts including Kenjutsu (sword), Sojutsu (spear) and Jujutsu. He was a deeply spiritual person and realized that peaceful resolutions were necessary for ending violence in the world. O-Sensei ultimately created a martial art in which aggression is met with compassion. Aikido is sometimes referred to as the "way of harmony."

        Aikido is primarily an unarmed art; however, there is substantial training with the sword and staff. Movement is characterized as dynamic, circular and efficient. Attacks are resolved through maintaining proper timing, distance, and feeling; conflict is avoided. With daily practice the body will become stronger and endurance greater. Along with the practical application of Aikido as a form of self-defense, the training can serve to improve one's quality of life by following the basic principles of Aikido: relax completely, stay calm, keep your center, and stay positive. As students continue to practice Aikido, they experience a transformation in mind, body, and spirit.

        Aikido is a martial art, but it does not encourage fighting; the focus is on developing self-protection skills and finding peaceful resolutions.
