      Testing is part of your evolution in Aikido.  

      There are six kyu level (white belt) and then three dan level (black belt) tests.  

      Kyu tests are conducted every March, July, and November for adult dojo members. Attitude, attendance and proficiency affect the eligibility to test.  For each rank there is a minimum amount of attendance that is a prerequisite to test.  In order to prepare sufficiently, you will want to surpass the minimum days, because you will be expected to perform under pressure.  Aikido is non-competitive, and testing is optional; however, if you wish to test, you must submit your application ten days before the test date.  If the applicant passes, he/she will receive ranking from USAF, which eventually can lead to a black belt in Aikido. However, in order to make progress students are encouraged to train at the dojo at least three times a week.

      Technical requirements are cumulative; you must be able to demonstrate all techniques from earlier levels.  Techniques from earlier levels must also show improvement.  In addition to the listed technique, you may be asked to demonstrate other variations. Techniques may also include an inside/outside (ura/omote) variation.  

      With consistent training and proper attitude, children will also be encouraged to take promotion tests and, if they pass, will receive a colored belt or a stripe.  Children’s testing begins at 20th kyu and ends with 7th kyu.  The belt colors change from white to red, orange, yellow, blue, purple, green, and brown.  The age range for the children’s program is seven through twelve.  Once the student becomes thirteen years of age then he/she will enter the adult program and begin testing at 6th kyu.  Children’s testing is conducted during the months of March, June, and November.
